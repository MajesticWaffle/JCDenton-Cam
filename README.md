# J.C. Denton Cam


tl;dr, a really bad vtuber program.
Switches between solid frames based on volume level of your microphone. Made to be used as a meme for school zoom calls.

Useage:

Run DentonCam.bat
Select folder with image slides. (Default: JC)

If mouth doesn't move enough, lower minimum volume in bat file (default: 0.70)
If it stays at the last stage too much, increase the maximum volume in bat file (default 5.0)
